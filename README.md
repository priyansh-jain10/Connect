node js, express, mongodb, postman, reactjs needed

For backend, Libraries needed:
(unzip node_modules.zip before use)


npm install --save express-validator mongoose 

express used to create the server
validator validates incoming requests which come to application ie payload of the requests witht 
cause we gon use mongodb (schema less), so we adding mongoose library so that we can add schema and all

npm --install dotenv
dotenv library used to run .env file

npm â€”-insatll nodemon
so that we dont need to start node again and again, it is going to watch and reload files
(dev cause dev dependency)

npm --install bcrypt
for password hashing and token creation via SHA256

Extra Notes:
express is an unopinionated framework, we can write our code in own style
route will create route path
models=database
controllers=logic
